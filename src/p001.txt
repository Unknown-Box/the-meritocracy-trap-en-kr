INTRODUCTION

Merit is sham. 
An entire civilization resists this conclusion. 
Every decent person agrees that advantage should be earned through ability and effort rather than inherited alongside caste. 
The meritocratic ideal - that social and economic rewards should track achievement rather than breeding - anchors the self-image of the age. Aristocracy has had its day, and meritocracy is now a basic tenet of civil religion in all advanced societies. 

Meritocracy promises to promote equality and opportunity by opening a previously hereditary elite to outsiders, armed with nothing save their own talents and ambitions. 
It further promises to harmonize private advantage and public interest, by insisting that wealth and status must be earned through accomplishment. 
Together, these ideals aspire to unite all of society behind a shared vision of hard work, skill, and deserved reward. 
But meritocracy no longer operates as promised. 
Today, middle-class children lose out to rich children at school, and middle-class adults lose out to elite graduates at work. 
Meritocracy blocks the middle class from opportunity. 
Then it blames those who lose a competition for income and status that, even when everyone plays by the rules, only the rich can win.
